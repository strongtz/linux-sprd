I2C for Spreadtrum platforms

Required properties:
- compatible: should be one of following:
	  "sprd,sharkl5-hw-i2c",
	  "sprd,roc1-hw-i2c",
	  "sprd,sharkl3-hw-i2c",
	  "sprd,orca-hw-i2c",
	  "sprd,sharkl5pro-hw-i2c".
- reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped region.
- interrupts: Should contain I2C interrupt.
- clock-names: The i2C for spreadtrum clock-names should contain i2c source
	  clk node, source clk enable, i2c clock node, clock for hardware
	  i2c enable.
	  Clock-names is fixed in i2c drivers, and its purpose is to
	  constrain the order of clocks property.Consumers drivers
	  will use clock-names to match clock input names with clocks
	  specifiers.
- clocks: The freq of source clk connected to i2c.List of clock input name
	  strings sorted in the same order as the clocks property, the
	  source clk enable must config, and the i2c source clk node,
	  i2c clock node, clock for hardware i2c enable are options.
- clock-frequency: The property is communication frequency of i2c controller
- #address-cells: Should be <1> address cells for i2c device address
- #size-cells: Should be <0> as i2c addresses have no size component

Optional properties:
- Child nodes conforming to i2c bus binding

Examples:
i2c5: i2c@32060000 {
	compatible = "sprd,sharkl5-hw-i2c";
	reg = <0 0x32060000 0 0x1000>;
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 68 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	clock-names = "source", "enable", "i2c",
		"clk_hw_i2c";
	clocks = <&ext_26m>,  <&aonapb_gate CLK_I2C_EB>,
		<&clk_hw_i2c>, <&clk_aon_top_gates 11>;
	clock-frequency = <400000>;
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;
};
